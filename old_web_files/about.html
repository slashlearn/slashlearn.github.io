	    The ultimate goal of this website is to use power of the internet and video
	    to eliminate the frustration
	    that comes with learning. I want to provide a free educational
	    resourse for students to use when they need something extra beyond the
	    traditional lectures and textbooks.

	    <h2>About Me:</h2>
	    <p>
	      I am currently a university student, and through my time being a student I have
	      found my math and computer science classes to be quite difficult. As a
	      result, I have had to do a
	      lot of self learning in order to gain an understanding of the material.
	      I came to the conclusion that other students may be struggling and created
	      this website to help those students looking for an additional resource
	      to learn.
