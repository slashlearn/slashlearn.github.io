      <h1>Introduction to Computer Science:</h1>
      <h3>About:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>Welcome to this introduction to computer science course. This course is meant
	  teach the fundamentals of computer science and programming using the language of
	  Java. If you are taking Ap Computer Science, an introductory programming class
	  in college, or you just want to get started with coding this is a great resource
	  for you. You do not need to have any prior experience with coding to follow this course,
	  you just need to know basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication etc). 
	</p>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Structure:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>This course consist of 21 lessons which cover the topics that you will need to
	  have a basic understanding of programming. Each lesson contains a video, written
	  material, and exercise(s) explaining the lesson's topics. The video and written material cover
	  the same information, they are simply presented in different ways. I would recommend
	  looking at both, but in most cases you can certainly just look at one if you choose. 
	</p>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Pacing:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>You get to decide how fast or slow you want to progress through this course. My one
	  recommendation is that you understand the concepts and can completely do the exercises
	  for each lesson before proceeding to the next. This way there are less "gaps" in your
	  knowledge which may become problematic because the material builds on itself.
