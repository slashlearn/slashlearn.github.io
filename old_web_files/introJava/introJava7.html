      <h3>Static Variables:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>
	  Static variables are variables that belong to a class. What exactly does this mean?
	  Well if you remember back to our person class. We had certain variables called
	  instance variables/fields (name, age, weight), each person had their own copy of this
	  variable. One person's age could be different from another person's age; however,
	  static variables are variables that every person shares and therefore they "belong"
	  to the class. Let's go back to our Person class we created earlier in Lesson 4 to
	  see an example of a static variable. 
	</p>	 
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Static Methods:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>
	  Similar to how static variables are variables that belong to a class. Static methods
	  are methods that belong to a class. Static methods do not operate on an instance
	  of  class. Let's look at an exaple of a static method as well as compare the
	  differences between a static and non-static method so we get a better understanding.
	</p>
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Constants:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>
	  Constants are variables that are not allowed to be changed throught the lifetime
	  of the program. To delcare aconstant we use the <strong>final</strong> keyword.
	  It is also customary to have the variable name of a final variable to be all
	  uppercase. Let's look at an example of using <strong>final</strong>. 
	</p>
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Comments:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>
	  Comments are text in our code that is ignored by the compiler. We use these
	  to comment on our code and explain what it is doing. This makes our code
	  easier to read and understand not only for ourselves but for others who may
	  potentially look at our code.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	  Let's look at an example of a single and multiline comment.
	</p>
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Javadoc Comments:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>
	  Javadoc comments are a special type of comment used for methods. Let's look at
	  an example of a Javadoc comment.
