	<h3>Objects:</h3>
	<div class="subSect">
	  <p>
	    If you remember back to the last lesson we learned about variables
	    and made a few ourselves. Some of which we called height, width,
	    and area. Now let’s pretend that these were attributes of a
	    rectangle, and we wanted to store these together as a rectangle.
	    Well this is where we use objects. We could make a Rectangle
	    object with certain height and width variables grouped together.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	    Objects are essentially groupings of variables and methods, and
	    they allow us to keep things more organized. For example, in the
	    event we want to make several rectangles, we can just make several
	    rectangle objects rather than making all the variables of a
	    rectangle’s multiple times. Storing the data as multiple rectangles
	    as opposed to multiple, heights, widths, and area’s allows for
	    better organization of the data. In addition to variables our
	    objects also have methods we can use on them: let's define what a method is.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Methods:</h3>
	<div class="subSect">
	  <div class="rightPic3">
	    <img src="3.2methodExample.PNG">
	    <p>
	      Sorry if this picture is a bit confusing, but it is meant to
	      demonstrate how you can use methods for code reuse. If we take
	      a look at our main program let's say we wanted to find the
	      perimeter of three rectangles that we have created. We could
	      write the instructions to get the perimeter of the rectangle
	      three times each corresponding to a separate rectangle. Or we could
	      do something like we have done here. We could make a method
	      that would get the perimeter of any rectangle and return
	      that perimeter value. We could then just call this method
	      three times instead of writing the instructions three times.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="leftText2">
	    <p>
	      Methods are a collection of instructions that perform a
	      specified task. Let’s say we made a rectangle object and
	      we want to find its perimeter. We might use a method called
	      find perimeter. Inside that method it would sum up the four
	      sides of the rectangle and return that value.
	    </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>In theory we wouldn’t really even need to know how a method works
	      in order to use it. For example let’s say you wanted to
	      find the length of a word. You could just use Java’s
	      built in length method for strings. You don’t need to
	      know about the algorithm inside the method that is used to find
	      the length of the word. You just need to call the length
	      method and know what it does. Which of course, it just
	      returns the length.  
	    </p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Classes:</h3>
	<div class="subSect">
	  <div class="rightPic3v2">
	    <img src="3.3classesExample.PNG">
	  </div>
	  <div class="leftText2">
	    <p>
	      Classes are the instructions or templates for the
	      objects to be created. If we think back to our
	      hypothetical rectangle objects. How would Java
	      know what variables and methods should be stored
	      in a rectangle. That is why we would need a Rectangle
	      class which would serve as a guide for the creation of objects.
	    </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>
	      So if we wanted to make three rectangle objects. What we
	      would end up doing is using the Rectangle class to create
	      3 different instances of a rectangle. (Another way to think
	      of objects is that they are instances of their class) Each
	      rectangle would have the same methods and kinds of variables,
	      but the variables could hold different values. In other
	      words, all rectangles will have a height variable, but their
	      height variables could all be different.

	  <p>Here we are going to make some rectangle objects<br> using
	    a Rectangle class that Java already has for us.

	    The picture to the right demonstrates the reoccurring format
	    used when calling a method.
	  </p>
	  <p>Here are some terms that are part of method calls</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Implicit Parameter: </strong>The object that the method is being
	      called on.</li>
	    <li><strong>Method Name: </strong>The name of the method being called</li>
	    <li><strong>Explicit Parameter: </strong>These are the arguments enclosed
	      inside a methods parentheses, they are the arguments you may send to
	      a method. In our example it was the width and height we sent.</li>
