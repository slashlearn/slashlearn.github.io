      <h3>What is a Program?</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>
	  All of us have used a program before, a video game, a text editor, or a calculator app are
	  all examples of programs. In the bare bones definition, programs are really just a set of
	  instructions the computer executes.
	  For example, in the video game tetris, a continuous loop of code which
	  detects for player input and then updates the graphics to the screen is being run
	  by the computer.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	  Programs are also extremely flexible in what they can do.
	  Think of all the different things you can do on your computer, from watching a movie to
	  writing a paper to procrastinating your homework on YouTube.
	  Once you learn how to code you are limited by only your imagination as to
	  what you want to create. You simply need to be able to instruct the computer what to do with
	  your code, and that is where algorithms come in. 
	</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Algorithms:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	
	<div class="leftText">
	  <p>
	    Algorithms are the instructions that the programs run. Think of algorithms as a recipe
	    or a set of instructions. If I said "I'm going to share my chocolate chip cookie recipe
	    with you" vs. if I said "I'm going to share my chocolate chip cookie algorithm with you,"
	    I would be saying the exact same thing! (My cookies taste pretty bad though)
	  </p>
	  </div>

	  </div>
	  <div class="leftText">
	  <br>
	  <p>
	    Algorithms can range from simple to incredibly complex. For example,
	    an algorithm to compare two numbers is pretty simple.
	    It might look something like this: 
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Check to see if the first number is bigger, and if it is tell the person
	      the first number is greater than the second.</li>
	    <li>Check to see if the second number is bigger, and if it is tell the person
	      the second number is greater than the first.</li>
	    <li>Otherwise tell the person that they are equal.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    The more complex algorithms…well those get really complicated just think of how complicated
	    the instructions to program artificial intelligence would be.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	    Algorithms have to be precise. Have you ever been using a calculator
	    and accidentally punched in a wrong digit or forgot a
	    parentheses, and that messed up your entire answer. I certainly have!
	    A calculator isn’t able to interpret what you “meant” to type in. It
	    only calculates exactly what you type in even if you’ve made a mistake.
	    Algorithms are the exact same way, you need to tell them specifically
	    what to do.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	    Looking back at my algorithm for comparing two numbers, imagine if
	    I forgot the last step of “Otherwise tell the person that they are equal,”
	    well you might think “Obviously! If one number isn’t greater than the
	    other they have to be equal.” Well you would be right, but my point
	    is that when you are writing an algorithm, the computer won’t know
	    this because a computer can’t interpret anything no matter how obvious.

      <h3>What is Java?</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>
	  Java is a programming language. A programming language is exactly what
	  it sounds like: a language that we write our code in to program computers.
	  Just how people can speak and understand languages, computers can interpret
	  programming languages, and just like how some people can understand multiple
	  languages computers can understand multiple programming languages. A few
	  examples of other programming languages are Python, C++, and Assembly.
	  Certain programming languages may be better suited for different tasks,
	  but here are a few advantages of Java that make it a good first language to learn.

      <h3>Advantages of Java:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<div class="rightPic">
	  <img src="javaGraphic.png" alt="Java Logo">
	</div>
	<div class="leftText">
	  <ol>
	    <li><strong>Easy to learn.</strong> Java takes care of a lot of the behind these
	      scenes tasks that you might have to take care of manually with another
	      language. For example, in C++ you have to properly manage the computer’s
	      memory, but Java does that for you.
	    </li>
	    <li><strong>High level programming language.</strong> This essentially means our
	      code is going to look closer to a human language. Machines technically
	      only understand numbers, but writing code in numbers is not practical.
	    </li>
	    <li><strong>Platform Independent</strong> Our Java code will run
	      the same regardless of whether you are using the Windows, Mac, or Linux
	      operating system.
	    </li>
	  </ol>

      <h3>Eclipse and JDK:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>If you already have JDK and a editor of your choice set up you can skip
	  this section
	</p>
	<p>You are going to need to install:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Eclipse</li>
	    <li>Java Development Kit: (Java but for Developers)</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	<p>The instructions for installation on windows are in the video (skip to 0:45).
	  If you have a mac or don't want to watch the video there are
	  plenty of online guides to get these two things installed. I also
	  teach you how to navigate Eclipse and run your first program.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Eclipse is an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE for short). This
	  is where you will be writing and running your code. Eclipse is what I
	  use, and I find it to be a great IDE for student. 
	  However, if you prefer another IDE or if you school is requiring that
	  you use something different this is completely ok. As long as you have
	  some way of writing and compiling Java code.
	</p>
	<br>

      <h3>Exercise 1.1:</h3>
      <div class="subSect">
	<p>This exercise is meant to make sure you know your way around
	  the Eclipse Developer Environment and that Java is working
	  properly on you computer.
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Print "./Learn is cool" to the console</li>
	  <li>Print "I am happy" to the console</li>
	</ol>
