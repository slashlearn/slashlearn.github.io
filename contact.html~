                I’m an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University studying computer science. 
                I’m particularly interested in app development as I enjoy creating useful tools for 
                everyday people. I’ve also recently begun to dig into the field of data science,
                particularly in the stock market. I’m new to coding, having only started my senior 
                year of high school. To improve, I frequently work on personal projects and some of
                those can be found right here on this website. In the future, I hope to work as a 
                software engineer at a tech or financial company.

                I was born in Seattle, Washington, but have moved around quite a lot. In fact, 
                I have lived in 9 different places including Houston, Irvine, and Washington D.C. 
                I’m currently living in Los Angeles for the summer. The pictures to the left are 
                the highlights of my summer here.

                I am working as a volunteer for Grace Yoo’s LA city council campaign. 
                My main tasks are downloading and analyzing political data as well as managing her website.

                I’m also working as an instructor for Juni Learning. Here I teach computer science concepts
                to K-12 students. The topics I teach range between basic syntax to intermediate data structures.

                Cycling: I love exploring the outdoors. When I lived in Irvine, I would always spend 
                my free time biking the trails of Southern California.  My longest ride was biking 
                the entire San Diego Creek Trail, a round trip of about 60 miles.

                Tennis: I have played tennis ever since I was a toddler. At certain times I have 
                loved every minute of it and at other times I have wanted to quit altogether. 
                I started playing competitively since the age of 8, and I both played on the USTA 
                and as member of my high school team. Now I play for the NCAA team at Johns Hopkins University.
