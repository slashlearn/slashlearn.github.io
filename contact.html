            I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a computer science degree
            at Johns Hopkins University. I’ve tutored students in math and computer
            science since high school, and as a student myself I know firsthand how it
            feels to be stumped by these daunting subjects. My struggles as a student
            and my experience as a tutor inspired me to create this website for other
            people who may find these subjects difficult to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have compiled class notes, textbooks, and online resources to create
            every lesson on this website. The goal behind these lessons is to provide
            a clear and concise explanation of concepts taught in a college course.
            Contrary to many classroom settings, learning should be exciting, interesting,
            and fun; therefore, I’ve attempted to make these lessons as engaging an
            interactive as possible through exercises, games, and quizzes.

          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately one may still find themselves confused no matter how the
            concepts are explained. Therefore, I have built in an online chat system
            that gives students the chance to ask for help and explain concepts to
            one another. Hopefully, this also builds a sense of community amongst
            users of this website and eliminates the frustration of learning by oneself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know how expensive online courses, coding bootcamps, or university can be,
            and thus I have made all lessons and features of this resources completely free.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am always looking to improve the lesson and websites. If you would like to
            suggest a change, provide constructive criticism or have a business inquiry
            feel free to email me.
